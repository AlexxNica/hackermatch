			Hackermatch was born out of a problem we had with going to hackathons. Finding hackers who complemented your skills and were passionate about the same technologies and projects was near impossible, and always ended in some compromise. We wanted to make it easier to find like minded people who thought about the same things and had the skills needed to make them a reality. Hackathons are great at bridging networks of ideas and people, but they are limited by the number of people you meet and have conversations with in a short period of time. Hackermatch is the natural progression, providing a means by which hackers can discuss ideas ahead of time, and form teams based on skills and interests rather than coincidence.
