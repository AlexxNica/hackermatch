Juan Alvarado,jalvarado91@gmail.com,"I want to make an online multiplayer foosball game. The game itself doesn't t have to be crazy or have insane graphics, probably something simple that can work with firebase in js would work fine. The twist is that I also want to make two foosball controllers. What do I mean by that, well, really I was thinking some shoeboxes with three sticks (one goalie, two player rows) hooked up to some arduinos. I've been thinking about the easiest ways of making this work and I think I've got it almost planned so it's simple but still functional. Essentially we'll use potentiometers to measure rotation and I have a bunch of ultrasonic distance sensors to measure the position of the sticks. ","People with hardware experience. I've only done super simple hardware hacks so this would be a stepping up. People with experience making dead simple js games in canvas or with a simple js engine so we can leverage firebase.

I mainly work in PHP at my job, but we use Laravel which is a lot like rails/django, and I'm comfortable with node too. Worked with express at previous hackathons. I'm also a pretty good android dev, but we probably won't use that for this project, and I've played with some hardware, not a lot.
